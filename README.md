A lightweight framework for friendly and functional Python scripting.

## Who is this For?

Py-Cli-Framework is for people looking for a quick place to start when creating simple Python scripts.  Frequently I found myself creating scripts to pull reports or automate tasks through REST APIs or from databases.  This project grew out of the pieces I found myself reusing over and over again to make my scripts usable by humans.

Projects like [Cement]() are a much more sophisticated solution, and seems to be for projects of a higher scale.  Py-Cli-Framework (PCF) is intended for small projects and scripts.

## Includes
- Your script is exposed as a command in your CLI once installed with `pip`
- Pre-configured log handling and log rolling
- Pre-configured CLI argument handling
-

## Getting Started

1. Fork the git repository
1. Rename the folder, script, and values in `setup.py` and `MyScript/const.py`
1. Rename this file to something else, and name `YOUR_README.md` to `README.md`
1. Start scripting in `MyScript/myscript.py` (or whatever you decide to call it!)
